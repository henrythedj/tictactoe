# tictactoe
Tic tac toe with a simple AI, made for The Odin Project

All you need to do is run this file from the command line ($ ruby tictactoe.rb) and it will run

As long as you are in the program, it will keep track of how many wins each player has. Player 0 is mr roboto, a stupid AI but he will always finish the game!
